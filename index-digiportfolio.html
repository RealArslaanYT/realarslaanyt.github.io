            <h1>Hey,</h1>
            <p>My name is Arslaan Pathan.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I’m 12 years old and I like computer science, writing stories
              (sometimes), Linux, FOSS (Free Open-Source Software), hacking,
              reverse-engineering and iOS jailbreaking. My favorite genre of
              music is Hyperpop, particularly Hyperpop-Digicore &
              Hyperpop-Glitchcore. One of my best (and most recent) projects is
              a (currently unfinished) fighter game titled Showdown of the
              Sticks, inspired by Alan Becker’s upcoming game Animation VERSUS.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I mainly use riced MacOS on my M2 MacBook Pro with a custom tiling
              window manager setup, custom-mapped keyboard shortcuts and a
              custom menu bar (thanks to yabai, skhd, SketchyBar, and
              JankyBorders) for daily-driving and most development/coding. My
              favorite games are Minecraft and Stick Fight: The Game. I’ve been
              programming and tinkering with devices since the age of six. What
              originally got me into programming was looking at my old iPad 2
              (which I still have as of 2025, six years later - it's now
              jailbroken with EtasonJB because I felt like it) and saying – “how
              are these apps made?”
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Feel free to explore my projects, stories, and achievements, and
              thanks for stopping by!
            </p>
